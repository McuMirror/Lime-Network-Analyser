# Re-writing now that I know more Python

# Lime Network Analyser
 
 This uses the example code from Myriad RF's Lime VNA, 
https://github.com/myriadrf/pyLMS7002Soapy.git
 
It is entirely Python and plots Return Loss and Through Loss in real time using 
pyqtgraph.  Two channels can be measured with the Lime-USB (although not 
concurrently).  I have tried to retain the compatibility with Lime-mini but I 
don't have one to test it with.

I made this programme because I wanted to learn Python.  I read various online 
tutorials and official Python documents.  Learnpyqt was particularly helpful and 
easy to understand https://www.learnpyqt.com/.  I used Qt-designer to make the 
GUI and Spyder in Anaconda to write and test my code.  It is probably Python 3.8 
because that's what I have.

I added a lot of comments to the Myriad RF example programme in order to try to 
understand how it works.  These may not be correct but are my best guesses.  I 
rearranged some of the code and moved chunks around.

Although it can measure Phase, and can write the data to a file that is 
compatible with the example 'CaluclateVNA.py', I have not yet figured out how to 
plot vector measurements although I guess it can be done with a matplotlib subplot.

With Vector measurements turned off (unticked) it can plot 50 points in 8 - 25 
sec.  This seems to depend on signal power, and I think it's related to 
calibrating residual DC offset.  It runs slower if you run it in Spyder, and 
about 4 times slower with Vector turned on.

I noticed that the original function 'adjustrxgain' only adjusts PGA gain 
despite returning LNA gain as well, so I added some code that sets LNA gain by 
aiming for RSSI of 50,000 with a fixed value of PGA gain (allowing for some 
headroom).

I am a beginner with Python and object-oriented languages so my coding may be 
poor.  Helpful comments welcome.

I have made measurements at a few frequencies in the low and high bands using 
some high quality (12GHz) RF attenuators and some ancient Telonic calibrated 
mismatches and the results are within about 2dB of expected.
